# Remarks
Regarding Coding Rules /b/n
This code represents my personal preference on coding rules and is NOT indicative of me being unable to adapt to your team's coding rule set. Team's preferences outweigh individual's preferences.

Dependency Injection /b/n
While I do not reject the use of DI, in my opinion it goes against KISS principles. I avoid using it for the sake of simplicity.
